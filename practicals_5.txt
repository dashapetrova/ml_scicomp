LICENSING AND REDISTRIBUTION

CODE

Exercise: read the Wikipedia articles on Apache, BSD, and MIT licenses. Describe the similarities and the differences.

All these licences are of permissive type and requires to keep the license file.
They all are permissive considering the linking, distribution and modification.
The Apache license thus requires you to keep not only the license file but also the NOTICE file if there is one, and show notice for modified files. It also addresses some patent-related issues, so companies use it a lot.
As for The MIT and BSD licenses, they have similar requirements. They both allow others to do nearly anything with the software including modifying it and using it in a product that they sell.
The difference between BSD and MIT is that some versions of the BSD license require to include the disclaimer when you distribute a product, the MIT license does not. Also the MIT license seems to be a bit simplier.

ART

Exercise: Pick a creative work (or make up a fictional one); come up with three obviously non-commercial uses of this work.

For example, some artist made an original drawing. three obviously non-commercial uses of this work are the following:
1. repost this art in some art commmunity
2. use the drawing as the background of the website
3. make it the part of the artist collaboration

Exercise: Now argue that all three of these uses are commercial.

1. reposting cool art may lead to the expansion of the audience of the community, so if they sell anything in their group, it may lead to the profit growth.
2. websites are often supported with advertising, so the more people visit their website, the more they get, and used drawing may attract more people to the website.
3. the artist collaboration may start in the free online form, and then the collection of artworks in the collaboration may be published.
Even if the published books will be given to people as a present (so no actual money for the authors), the company that is responsible for printing gets money for their work.
Also all the authors (especially the organizator of the collaboration) may gain more popularity which leads to the growth of profit when selling some other drawings/works/merch.

DATA

Exercise: What is the effect on science reproducibility if the data set is not liberally licensed?

Then it is hard to get the data for the research, and it may has a lot of prohibitions considering its usage.
If the data set is found by scraping websites, and the data is not available for usage, it may be hard to reproduce the project because the websites are always being updated, especially some news sources and social networks.
If the data is found from the company, it is not necessary that someone else will be able to get the same data for the same purposes.
So it all slows down the science in some way.

Exercise: give an example of a proprietary data source; what could you do with that data if it were liberally licensed?

For example, there is a neural network GPT-3 created by OpenAI, which is not available for free for everyone but for few other development companies.
If the model was liberally licensed, more people, especially novice developers, could use the model for own projects, study the model's achiteture in more detail, maybe even improve it, which is good for science and technology development.

ACTIVITY / PRACTICAL

Write a data policy for your НИС. This should include:

1. a description of what data you will use
We use arg-microtexts-multilayer-rus-eng corpus: 112 short argumentative texts in English with the Russian translation (human and three variants of machine), annotated according to three different theories of discourse structure.

2. where that data comes from, and what license it is under
The corpus, the annotations and the associated code are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
A human-readable summary of the licence agreement can be found here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

3. (roughly) what you will do with the data
We annotate the human Russian translations manually and automatically.
Annotation is divided into two parts: segmentation of the texts into smaller parts (elementary discourse units) and defining the rhetotical relations between them.
Automatic annotations are got by two methods: adapting the existing Russian parser and by transfering the annotation from English.

4. whether you can/will release the data, and under what license
In the license description the following information is written: "If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original."
So we can release our results, and we should use the same license for it.

5. how another research group will be able to reproduce your project
The data will be uploaded online (on github, for example), as well as the code and the paper about the project. The code is written in Python which is available online and free too.
Considering that there is no random component in the algorithms, the results are supposed to be reproducable.
